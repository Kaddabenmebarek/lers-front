## Getting started

Import the labinventory-fend directory as a maven project (and not a gradle project).

### Maven configuration
The maven project requires you to have a valid configuration of the internal repositories URLs.   
You may need to edit your `~/.m2/settings.xml` to include them. See a configuration example in `settings_example.xml`.

### Before starting the client
Before launching the client, make sure that the webservice ws-osiris and wslabinventory are running.
